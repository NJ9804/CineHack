# Quick Fix: Token Signature Mismatch (401 Error)

## Problem
Your token is being sent correctly, but it's being **rejected by the backend** with error:
```
❌ Token validation failed: Signature verification failed.
```

## Root Cause
The `SECRET_KEY` used to create your current token doesn't match the backend's current `SECRET_KEY`. This happens when:
- Backend restarted with a different SECRET_KEY
- Environment variables changed
- Token was created with old credentials

## Solution: Log In Again

### Step 1: Clear Old Token (Optional)
Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('token')
```

### Step 2: Log In
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Enter your credentials
3. Click "Login"

### Step 3: Verify New Token
After login, check the console - you should see:
```
🌐 [HTTP] POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login
🔑 [AUTH] Token present: YES (eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1Ni...)
```

### Step 4: Test Tickets
1. Navigate to your project page
2. Click the "🎫 Tickets" tab
3. The tickets should now load successfully!

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix (Current):
```
INFO   127.0.0.1:56636 - "OPTIONS /api/projects/1/tickets HTTP/1.1" 200
INFO   127.0.0.1:56636 - "GET /api/projects/1/tickets HTTP/1.1" 401  ❌
```

### After Fix (After Re-login):
```
INFO   127.0.0.1:56636 - "OPTIONS /api/projects/1/tickets HTTP/1.1" 200
INFO   127.0.0.1:56636 - "GET /api/projects/1/tickets HTTP/1.1" 200  ✅
```

## Alternative: Check If You Have Login Credentials

If you don't remember your login credentials, you may need to create a new user. Check the `create_superuser.py` script in the Backend folder.

**Status**: The ticketing system code is working correctly ✅  
**Issue**: You just need a fresh authentication token 🔑
