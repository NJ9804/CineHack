# ðŸš€ Invoice Upload System - Quick Start Guide

## Step 1: Set Up API Key

Get your Google Gemini API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

```bash
# Windows
set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Linux/Mac
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Step 2: Run Database Migration

```bash
cd Backend
python migrate_invoice_upload.py
```

Expected output:
```
âœ“ Tables created successfully
âœ“ Created directory: uploaded_invoices
Migration completed successfully!
```

## Step 3: Test the System

```bash
python test_invoice_upload.py
```

Choose option 1 to test AI extraction with a sample invoice.

## Step 4: Upload Your First Invoice

### Via API (Using curl or Postman)

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/invoice/upload" \
  -F "file=@invoice.jpg" \
  -F "project_id=1" \
  -F "user_id=1" \
  -F "category=catering" \
  -F "notes=Lunch for shoot day 5"
```

### Via Python Script

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/invoice/upload"

files = {"file": open("invoice.jpg", "rb")}
data = {
    "project_id": 1,
    "user_id": 1,
    "category": "catering",
    "notes": "Daily catering expense"
}

response = requests.post(url, files=files, data=data)
print(response.json())
```

## Step 5: Configure Approval Thresholds

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/invoice/settings/1" \
  -F "auto_approve_threshold=5000" \
  -F "manager_approval_threshold=25000" \
  -F "director_approval_threshold=100000"
```

## Step 6: View Invoices

```bash
# Get all invoices for project
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/invoice/invoices/1"

# Get pending approvals only
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/invoice/invoices/1?approval_status=pending"

# Get specific invoice details
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/invoice/invoice/1"
```

## Step 7: Approve/Reject Invoices

### Approve
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/invoice/invoice/1/approve" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "approver_id": 2,
    "comments": "Approved - valid expense"
  }'
```

### Reject
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/invoice/invoice/1/reject" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "rejector_id": 2,
    "reason": "Invoice amount doesn't match quote"
  }'
```

## ðŸ“Š Understanding the Workflow

### Auto-Approved (< â‚¹5,000)
```
Upload â†’ AI Extract â†’ Auto-Approve â†’ Ready for Payment
```

### Manager Approval (â‚¹5,000 - â‚¹25,000)
```
Upload â†’ AI Extract â†’ Manager Review â†’ Approve/Reject â†’ Payment
```

### Director Approval (> â‚¹25,000)
```
Upload â†’ AI Extract â†’ Director Review â†’ Approve/Reject â†’ Payment
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Common Use Cases

### Case 1: Daily Catering Bill
```
Amount: â‚¹3,500
Category: catering
Result: Auto-approved
Action: None required
```

### Case 2: Equipment Rental
```
Amount: â‚¹45,000
Category: equipment
Result: Requires Director approval
Action: Director must review and approve
```

### Case 3: High-Value Purchase
```
Amount: â‚¹1,50,000
Category: equipment
Result: Requires dual approval
Action: Both Director and Producer must approve
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "GEMINI_API_KEY not set"
**Solution:** Set the environment variable before starting the server

### Issue: Low AI confidence score
**Solution:** 
- Ensure invoice image is clear and well-lit
- Check that text is readable
- Try uploading a higher resolution image

### Issue: Invoice not requiring approval when expected
**Solution:**
- Check approval threshold settings
- Verify invoice amount
- Review category-specific thresholds

## ðŸ“± Integration with Frontend

### Upload Form Example (React)
```jsx
const uploadInvoice = async (file, projectId, userId) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', file);
  formData.append('project_id', projectId);
  formData.append('user_id', userId);
  
  const response = await fetch('/api/v1/invoice/upload', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
  });
  
  return await response.json();
};
```

### Display Invoice List Example
```jsx
const InvoiceList = ({ projectId }) => {
  const [invoices, setInvoices] = useState([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`/api/v1/invoice/invoices/${projectId}`)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setInvoices(data.invoices));
  }, [projectId]);
  
  return (
    <div>
      {invoices.map(inv => (
        <InvoiceCard 
          key={inv.id}
          invoice={inv}
          onApprove={handleApprove}
          onReject={handleReject}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Next Steps

1. **Set up notification system** - Alert approvers when invoices need review
2. **Create dashboard** - Show pending approvals, total expenses, etc.
3. **Add budget integration** - Link invoices to budget lines
4. **Generate reports** - Export expense reports by category/department
5. **Mobile app** - Enable on-location invoice uploads

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Best Results

### For Quality AI Extraction:
- âœ“ Take clear, well-lit photos
- âœ“ Ensure all text is readable

- âœ“ Link to relevant scenes
- âœ“ Respond to clarifications quickly
- âœ“ Review low-confidence extractions

### For Better Accountability:
- âœ“ Always provide rejection reasons
- âœ“ Use comments for discussions
- âœ“ Verify vendor details
- âœ“ Check for duplicates
- âœ“ Keep approval records
