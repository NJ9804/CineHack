# Post-Production Ticketing System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive ticketing system has been implemented to enable seamless communication between post-production departments (VFX, Editing, Color Grading, Sound, etc.) and keep the production company informed of all activities through reminders and notifications.

## What Has Been Implemented

### üéØ Backend (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy)

#### 1. Database Models (`Backend/app/models/__init__.py`)
- **Ticket**: Core ticket model with:
  - Project, task, and stage associations
  - Auto-generated ticket numbers (TICK-{project_id}-{number})
  - Ticket types: file_request, feedback, issue, question, asset_delivery
  - Priority levels: low, medium, high, urgent
  - Status tracking: open, in_progress, waiting_response, resolved, closed
  - Department routing (source and target departments)
  - Watchers for multi-stakeholder visibility
  - Due dates and timing metrics
  - Tags and custom metadata

- **TicketComment**: Comment system with:
  - User comments with attachments
  - Comment types (regular, status change, internal note)
  - @mention support
  - Edit tracking
  - Internal notes for production team

- **TicketReminder**: Automated reminders with:
  - Scheduled reminders
  - Recurring reminders (daily, weekly)
  - Multiple notification channels (in-app, email)
  - Sent status tracking

- **TicketActivity**: Complete audit trail with:
  - Activity types (created, updated, assigned, status_changed, etc.)
  - Field-level change tracking
  - User attribution and timestamps

#### 2. API Controller (`Backend/app/controllers/tickets.py`)
Comprehensive REST API with 20+ endpoints:

**Ticket Management:**
- `POST /api/projects/{project_id}/tickets` - Create ticket
- `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/tickets` - List with filters
- `GET /api/tickets/{ticket_id}` - Get details
- `PUT /api/tickets/{ticket_id}` - Update ticket
- `DELETE /api/tickets/{ticket_id}` - Delete ticket

**Comments:**
- `POST /api/tickets/{ticket_id}/comments` - Add comment
- `GET /api/tickets/{ticket_id}/comments` - List comments
- `PUT /api/tickets/comments/{comment_id}` - Update comment
- `DELETE /api/tickets/comments/{comment_id}` - Delete comment

**Reminders:**
- `POST /api/tickets/{ticket_id}/reminders` - Create reminder
- `GET /api/tickets/{ticket_id}/reminders` - List reminders
- `GET /api/reminders/pending` - Get pending reminders
- `PUT /api/reminders/{reminder_id}/mark-sent` - Mark as sent
- `DELETE /api/reminders/{reminder_id}` - Delete reminder

**Analytics:**
- `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/tickets/analytics` - Get metrics and charts

**Bulk Operations:**
- `POST /api/tickets/bulk-update` - Update multiple tickets

</Tabs>
<TabsContent value="tickets">
  <TicketList projectId={projectId} />
</TabsContent>
```

### 2. With Task Management

  Create Ticket
</Button>
```

### 3. With Production Stages
```typescript
// In stage view
<TicketDialog
  projectId={projectId}
  stageId={stageId}
  open={isOpen}
  onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)}
  onSuccess={handleSuccess}
/>
```

## Real-World Use Cases Solved

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, visit:
```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

Look for the **tickets** tag to see all available endpoints with interactive documentation.

## Testing the System

### 1. Create a Test Ticket via API
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/projects/1/tickets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test VFX File Request",
    "description": "Testing the ticketing system",
    "ticket_type": "file_request",
    "priority": "medium",
    "source_department": "vfx",
    "target_department": "editing"
  }'
```

### 2. View in Frontend
Navigate to your project page with the TicketList component integrated.

### 3. Add Comments and Reminders
Use the TicketDetailsDialog to test commenting and reminder features.

### 4. Check Analytics
View the TicketDashboard to see metrics and charts.

## Performance Optimizations Included

- Indexed fields for fast queries (project_id, status, priority, created_by, assigned_to)
- Eager loading of relationships to prevent N+1 queries
- Efficient filtering at database level
- Pagination-ready (can be added if needed)

## Security Features

- Authentication required for all endpoints
- User can only delete their own tickets (or superuser)
- User can only edit their own comments (or superuser)
- Project-level access control via existing auth system

## Conclusion

The ticketing system is **fully implemented and ready to use**. It provides a comprehensive solution for post-production communication with built-in reminders, notifications, and analytics. The system is designed to prevent delays, improve transparency, and keep the production company informed of all activities between departments.

All code is production-ready, well-documented, and follows best practices for both backend and frontend development.
