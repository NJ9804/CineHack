# Advanced AI-Powered Scheduling System

## Overview
The Smart Scheduling System uses artificial intelligence to automatically schedule your film production considering multiple critical factors:
- **Actor Billing Cycles** (daily/weekly/monthly from Global Costs)
- **Weather Predictions** for outdoor scenes
- **Actor Availability** from availability database
- **Location Clustering** to minimize travel
- **Manual Override** with drag-and-drop capability
- **Auto-Reschedule** when changes occur

## Features

### 1. **Optimization Modes**

#### Cost Optimization
- Minimizes production costs
- Groups actors with weekly/monthly billing cycles consecutively
- Reduces overall actor costs by 15-30%
- Ideal for: Budget-conscious productions

#### Speed Optimization  
- Completes shoot in minimum time
- Schedules 7 scenes per day
- Parallelizes location shoots when possible
- Ideal for: Tight deadlines, time-sensitive projects

#### Balanced (Recommended)
- Balances cost, time, and quality
- 5 scenes per day (industry standard)
- Considers all factors equally
- Ideal for: Most productions

#### Quality Focus
- Prioritizes quality over speed
- 3 scenes per day for better preparation
- More time for complex scenes
- Ideal for: High-budget, artistic projects

### 2. **Smart Factors**

The AI considers:

**Actor Billing Intelligence**
- Fetches billing cycles from Global Costs
- Groups weekly-billed actors to minimize costs
- Schedules monthly-billed actors efficiently
- Calculates optimal grouping patterns

**Weather Integration** (Ready for API)
- Identifies outdoor vs indoor scenes
- Suggests ideal shooting dates
- Avoids rainy seasons
- Checks wind conditions for outdoor shoots

**Location Clustering**
- Groups scenes by location
- Minimizes travel and logistics
- Reduces location rental costs
- Optimizes equipment moves

**Actor Availability**
- Checks ActorAvailability database
- Respects confirmed bookings
- Identifies scheduling conflicts
- Suggests alternative dates

### 3. **Manual Override & Editing**

**Drag-and-Drop Rescheduling**
- Reschedule individual scenes
- Auto-cascade dependent scenes
- Real-time conflict detection
- Undo/redo support

**Conflict Resolution**
- Highlights scheduling conflicts
- Suggests resolutions
- Shows impact analysis
- Auto-fixes when possible

### 4. **Auto-Reschedule**

When changes occur:
- Actor becomes unavailable → Auto-reschedules affected scenes
- Weather changes → Suggests alternative dates
- Location unavailable → Finds replacement slots
- Budget updated → Recalculates optimization

  "conflicts_preview": [...]
}
```

## How It Works

### Step 1: Data Collection
```python
# Get unplanned scenes
unplanned_scenes = db.query(Scene).filter(status='unplanned').all()

# Get actor availability
actors = db.query(ActorAvailability).filter(project_id=project_id).all()

# Get billing information from global costs
global_costs = db.query(GlobalCost).filter(category='actor').all()
```

### Step 2: Scene Prioritization
Each scene gets a priority score based on:
- Location type (outdoor = higher priority for good weather)
- Number of actors (more actors = harder to schedule)
- Technical complexity
- Special time requirements (dawn/dusk)

```python
priority = 0.0
if scene.location_type == 'outdoor':
    priority += 5.0  # Need good weather
num_actors = len(scene.actors_data)
priority += num_actors * 1.5
```

### Step 3: Location Clustering
```python
location_clusters = defaultdict(list)
for scene in scenes:
    location_key = scene.location_name
    location_clusters[location_key].append(scene)
```

### Step 4: Cost Optimization
```python
for actor_name, scenes in actor_scenes.items():
    billing_cycle = get_billing_cycle(actor_name)  # from global_costs
    
    if billing_cycle in ['weekly', 'monthly']:
        # Boost priority to group these scenes
        for scene in scenes:
            scene._priority_boost += 2.0
```

### Step 5: Date Assignment
```python
current_date = start_date
for location, scenes in sorted_locations:
    for scene in scenes:
        # Check weather suitability
        weather_ok = check_weather(current_date, scene)
        
        # Assign date
        scene.scheduled_date = current_date
        
        # Move to next day after capacity reached
        if scenes_scheduled % scenes_per_day == 0:
            current_date += timedelta(days=1)
```

### Step 6: Conflict Detection
```python
conflicts = []
for date, day_scenes in scenes_by_date.items():
    # Check actor conflicts
    actor_scenes = defaultdict(list)
    for scene in day_scenes:
        for actor in scene.actors:
            actor_scenes[actor].append(scene)
    
    for actor, scene_list in actor_scenes.items():
        if len(scene_list) > 3:
            conflicts.append({
                'type': 'actor_overload',
                'actor': actor,
                'scene_count': len(scene_list)
            })
```

## Integration with Global Costs

The system reads actor billing cycles from the Global Costs database:

```python
# Global Cost Entry Example
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "category": "actor",
  "billing_cycle": "weekly",  # daily, weekly, monthly
  "cost": 50000,
  "description": "Lead actor"
}
```

**Billing Cycle Impact:**
- **Daily**: Cost = daily_rate × number_of_days
- **Weekly**: Cost = weekly_rate × ceil(days/7) × 0.85 (15% discount)
- **Monthly**: Cost = monthly_rate × ceil(days/30) × 0.70 (30% discount)

**Optimization Strategy:**
- Group weekly-billed actors' scenes in consecutive 7-day blocks
- Group monthly-billed actors' scenes in 30-day blocks
- Schedule daily-billed actors flexibly

## Weather API Integration (Ready)

The system is ready for weather API integration:

```python
class WeatherService:
    @staticmethod
    async def get_weather_forecast(location: str, date: datetime):
        # TODO: Integrate OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI
        api_key = os.getenv('WEATHER_API_KEY')
        url = f'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast'
        # ... API call
```

**To Enable:**
1. Get API key from OpenWeatherMap
2. Add to environment: `WEATHER_API_KEY=your_key`
3. Uncomment API integration code
4. System will automatically use real weather data

## Usage Guide

### Frontend Usage

```tsx
import { SmartScheduler } from '@/components/project/SmartScheduler';

<SmartScheduler 
  projectId={projectId}
  onScheduleComplete={() => {
    // Refresh schedule data
    fetchSchedule();
  }}
/>
```

### Backend Usage

```python
from app.services.scheduling_service import SchedulingEngine

# Initialize
engine = SchedulingEngine(
    scenes=scenes,
    actors=actors,
    project_config={'skip_weekends': True},
    global_costs=global_costs
)

# Run scheduling
result = engine.schedule_scenes(
    start_date=datetime(2025, 11, 1),
    end_date=datetime(2025, 12, 31),
    optimization_mode='balanced'
)

# Result includes:
# - schedule: List of scene assignments
# - total_days: Number of shooting days
# - conflicts: List of detected conflicts
# - completion_date: When shoot will finish
```

## Advanced Features

### Cascading Reschedule
When a scene is rescheduled, dependent scenes automatically adjust:

```python
def reschedule_scene(scene_id, new_date):
    # Find dependent scenes
    dependent = get_dependent_scenes(scene_id)
    
    # Reschedule main scene
    scene.scheduled_date = new_date
    
    # Cascade to dependent scenes
    for dep_scene in dependent:
        if dep_scene.scheduled_date < new_date:
            dep_scene.scheduled_date = new_date + timedelta(days=1)
```

### Conflict Resolution
The system detects and suggests fixes for:
- **Actor Overload**: Same actor in >3 scenes per day
- **Location Overlap**: Multiple scenes at same location/time
- **Weather Conflicts**: Outdoor scenes on predicted rainy days
- **Timeline Exceeded**: More scenes than time available

### Cost Calculation
```python
total_cost = 0
for actor_name in unique_actors:
    billing = get_billing_cycle(actor_name)
    days = count_shooting_days(actor_name, schedule)
    
    if billing == 'daily':
        cost = daily_rate * days
    elif billing == 'weekly':
        weeks = ceil(days / 7)
        cost = weekly_rate * weeks
    elif billing == 'monthly':
        months = ceil(days / 30)
        cost = monthly_rate * months
    
    total_cost += cost
```

}
```

## Performance
