# 🔧 Promotions Feature - Final Testing Guide

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Problem**: When clicking "Analyze Trends", the frontend wasn't displaying the results properly.

**Root Cause**: Mismatch between backend response structure and frontend TypeScript types.

**Solution**: Updated TypeScript types and API client to match the actual backend response structure.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No Promotion Analytics Yet" still shows after analysis

**Check**:
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12)
// Look for these logs:
console.log('Create promotion response:', {...})
// Should show: { success: true, promotion_id: X, report: {...} }

console.log('Loaded promotions:', [...])
// Should show array of promotions
```

**Solution**: 
- Verify backend is running on port 8000
- Check browser console for API errors
- Ensure project ID is valid

---

### Issue: Analysis takes too long or fails

**Possible causes**:
1. YouTube API rate limit reached
2. Film name has no videos
3. Backend timeout

**Solutions**:
- Try a popular film name
- Check backend terminal for errors
- Wait and retry

---

### Issue: Data not refreshing

**Solution**:
- Click the "Refresh" button
- Check browser console for errors
- Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R
