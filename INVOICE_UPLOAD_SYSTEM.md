## üéØ Best Practices

### For Production Team
1. Upload invoices immediately after receiving
2. Add clear purpose/notes for each invoice
3. Link invoices to relevant scenes when applicable
4. Review AI-extracted data for accuracy
5. Flag low-confidence extractions for manual review

### For Approvers
1. Review invoices promptly (escalation after 48 hours)
2. Provide detailed rejection reasons
3. Use comments for clarifications
4. Verify vendor details for new vendors
5. Check for duplicates before approving

### For Finance Team
1. Configure appropriate thresholds per project
2. Set up category-specific limits
3. Enable dual approval for high amounts
4. Use internal notes for sensitive information
5. Regularly review approval patterns

## üîç Monitoring & Reports

### Dashboard Metrics
- Total invoices uploaded
- Pending approvals count
- Average approval time
- Total expenses by category
- AI extraction accuracy

### Export Options
- Export invoice data to CSV
- Generate expense reports by category
- Approval delay reports
- Vendor-wise expense summary

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Low AI Confidence
If extraction confidence is < 0.5:
1. Check image quality
2. Ensure text is clearly visible
3. Manual verification required
4. Consider re-uploading higher quality image

### Approval Not Required When Expected
Check:
1. Approval threshold settings
2. Invoice amount vs. threshold
3. Category-specific thresholds
4. Auto-approve settings

### File Upload Errors
Verify:
1. File size < 10MB
2. File type is JPG, PNG, or PDF
3. File is not corrupted
4. Upload directory has write permissions

## üìû Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the API documentation
2. Review error logs in `backend/logs`
3. Verify Gemini API key is set
4. Check database connectivity
